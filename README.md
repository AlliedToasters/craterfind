# CRATERFIND (In Development)

This is a prototype application for AI-assisted "one-click" crater annotation by human annotators.

## Overview

CRATERFIND uses a neural network model to locate a crater given a rough crater location and an input image. This information is provided by an annotator with a single click.

## Purpose of This Repository

Much work is being done on solving this problem, but CRATERFIND works on the specific problem of integrating this technology with existing user interfaces.
